#Bounus Material
=============================
Here you'll find a bunch of bonus materials and work that will help with your ruby programing

In each `hw_#` directory, I'll give you a set of problems/ directions that corresponds with each week's of material.  

All work here is optional.  You can definitely push your code underneath your own `hw_#` directories.

##### Let's test how much you know about Ruby on Rails!
