##Project Proposals:
----------

###Content

* **Overview**: What is this project?
* **Topics Covered**: What skills are we using?
* **Timeline**: When is it due?
* **Specs**: What are the core features?
* **Tips**: Do you have any helpful advice?
* **Things to start thinking about?**: How to break it down to get to your MVP!

<br>

####Overview
For the final project you will use your knowledge of back-end web development to produce a Ruby on Rails application that will **demonstrate understanding of all topics covered during this course by building a web application from the ground up.** 

-----------------------
####Topics

By the time you submit this project, you will have leveled-up in many big themes in the course:

* **Git:** Manage and interact with a git repository to store changes to code.
* **Back-End Ruby on Rails:** Work with Models, Views, Controllers framework, and be familiar with RESTful routing.
* **Front-End:** Practice your front-end skills with using Bootstrap framework
* **External APIs:** Use an external API to add functionality to your app.
* **User Login:** Make sure you have authentication and authorization set up.
* **User Experience:** Ensure a pleasing and logical user experience. It is suggested to use a front-end CSS framework like Bootstrap to enhance and ease your CSS styling.

####Timeline

######When is it due?


**Last Day of class: Tuesday, February 9th**
____

####Specs:

**Projects must include:**

* An about page or a detailed description of your app.

* User accounts. Your application must utilize user login (authentication and authorization capability)

* Hosted. No need to pay for hosting services, you can Heroku, set up an account as soon a possible.

* Ruby Gems. Use a Ruby Gem (not the Rails defaults, obviously they don't count). Some ideas to look into: twilio-gem, carrier wave,

* Validations to handle invalid data. Forms in your application should validate data and handle incorrect inputs. (i.e. validate sign up information, verify valid email addresses and secure passwords).

* NOTE: Scaffolding is completely prohibited in final projects

* Make use of associations. At least **two of your models should be associated.**

* Basic Front Integration using Bootstrap

* Extra Credit: API integration (i.e., etsy for an example)

-------------------

####Tips:
Do you have any helpful advice?

* **Break the project down into different components** (model, routes, APIs, presentation, views, user stories, style) and brainstorm each component individually. 
* **Use your Development Tools and Debugging tools** (pry, bye-bug, better-errors, inspector) to debug and solve problems
* **Use your classmates as resources**, once you have asked 2 people & Googled it, feel free to ask a TA or instructor.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Write commit messages that help you remember what you've changed in each commit.
* **Don’t be afraid to break something** because you can always go back in time to a previous version (given you have followed the previous tip).
* **Use the Ruby docs and Active Record docs, and be a Google wizard** This is what developers spend most of their time doing!

###Some useful tools 

####User Stories

**User Stories:** are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. 
<br>	
They typically follow a simple template:


As a `type of user`, I want `some goal` so that `so for some reason`.

**Examples:**

As a `volunteer`, I want to `view listings of volunteer positions` 
so that I can `join an organization. `

As a `new user`, I want to be able to `create a new account`.

As a `tweeter`, I want to `automatically`  `share my quips on facebook`

<br>

####Wireframes


**Wireframes:** It’s an important step in any screen design process. It primarily allows you to define the information hierarchy of your design, making it easier for you to plan the layout according to how you want your user to process the information.

###Useful Resources

##Things to start thinking about?

###Scope
What are you planning to build? 
What features will it have? 
If you run out of time, will you have a working app without completing everything you want to implement? 
Focus on a Minimum Viable Project first

###Wireframes
Sketch out your core screens and how they will work. 
Start with paper or a whiteboard, because you are then much less married to the outcome, can make quick revisions, and not worry about learning yet another tool when you already have very limited time.

###Milestones
Outline some milestones for yourself based on how you prefer to work.

####Please complete your Trello Possible Pitches Boards by Thursday, January 7th 2016!
