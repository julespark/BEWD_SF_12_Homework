1. Method is to not do redundant work over and over.
2. DRY = Don't Repeat Yourself
3. Defining is just writing our what the code is supposed to do, whereas calling it performs the operation.
4. What is 'a'?; all the calculations have to be on the left side



a << adds to the end of the array


a.pop removes from the end of the arry; very last one
shift returns the first one (simliar to pop, but for the front


----
#Create hash with string keys, NOTE curly brackets!
s = { "a" => 5, "b" => 10}

#Create hash with symbol keys
h = {a:6, b:9, c:1}
h[:a] #symbols
h["a"] = null

hashes will have => 

#Show that symbol and string key are not the same
#Access hash value
#Add hash value



hash would be useful for when accessing information that is not necessarily in order; name-phone#, memberId = cost, etc. anything associated to someone or something

array would be useful for storing numbers or adding in new information that comes in; anonymous data for survey results, lottery
--order is important, list
--days of the week and order is important
